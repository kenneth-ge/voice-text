Voice to text word processor... but with editing features! And built with voice as a first priority, not an add-on. Also has foot pedal support to run commands.

Reserved commands:
* paste
* paste clear

Pedal commands:
* Hold down to trigger command prompt anywhere (even when not focusing on window)
  * After you start searching through the text, you can press the pedal to scroll through the options
* Double click pedal to clear options when editing text

Commands after you get search options (three options):
* An action command
* One command to make a selection, using the number, followed by another separate command to do an action ("remove," "delete," "append," "insert")
* OR a number, followed by an action, to do them both in one go
